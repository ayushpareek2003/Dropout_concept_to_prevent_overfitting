# Dropout_concept_to_prevent_overfitting

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use of dropout layers in neural networks to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a regularization technique commonly used in machine learning and deep learning models to improve generalization performance.

## Overview

Overfitting is a common challenge in machine learning, where a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, resulting in poor performance on unseen data. Dropout is a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting by randomly "dropping out" (ignoring) a fraction of neurons during training. This introduces a form of redundancy in the network, making it more robust.

This Jupyter Notebook provides a clear demonstration of incorporating dropout layers into a neural network using the TensorFlow and Keras framework.
